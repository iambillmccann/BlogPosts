### Do we really need borders?
### The profit move
One of the greatest misconceptions of business is the adage that "we in this to make money". Or worse, "the goal [of a business] is to maximize shareholder return".
These are false statements.
The goal of a business is to provide something of value to its' customers. The only reason to chase profile is to remain in business in order to continue providing a valuable product (or service).
Very high profits are a signal that prices are too high.This is a sign of mis-management.
Low profits or losses are also a signal of mis-management.
